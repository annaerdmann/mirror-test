# granite-geospatial-ocean

The granite-geospatial-ocean foundation model was jointly developed by IBM and STFC as part of a collaboration with the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Lab under the UK HNCDI programme. This pre-trained model supports a range of potential use cases in ocean ecosystem health, fisheries management, pollution and other ocean processes that can be monitored using ocean colour observations. We provide an example to fine tune the model to quantify primary production by phytoplankton (carbon sequestration which determine's the ocean's role in climate change). 


## Architecture Overview

The granite-geospatial-ocean model is a transformer-based geospatial foundation model trained on Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) images. The model consists of a self-supervised encoder developed with a ViT architecture and Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) learning strategy, with an MSE loss function and follows the same architecture as [Prithvi-EO](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-nasa-geospatial/prithvi-for-earth-observation-6740a7a81883466bf41d93d6). 

We used a 42x42 image size and 16 bands of Level-2 sentinel-3 OLCI(OL1 to OL12, OL16, OL17, OL18 and OL21) and also a further band of Level-2 SLSTR sea surface temperature data were in the pre-training. In total of 512,000 images were used for pre-training.

## How to Get Started with the Model 

We have provided an example of fine-tuning the model for primary production quantification which can be found [here](./notebooks/fine_tuning.ipynb). These examples make use of [TerraTorch](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch) for fine-tuning and prediction.
